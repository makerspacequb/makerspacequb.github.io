    "<h2>Task 1</h2><p>Printing is an essential tool of any programming language because it allows us to see what's inside of our program whilst it's running. Without it finding out what the program has produced is impossible! <br>To do this we write a <b>command</b> (a line that tells the program to do an action) containing a keyword python understands. To output a word we use <b>'print()'</b> which is a python function (more about functions later) that will print out whatever is inside its brackets. <br>For example writing <b>print(\"abc\")</b> would print out abc. Also note that these quotes are very important to tell python that abc is a word and not code!<br><h4> Now try for yourself: Use the print() function to output 'Hello World'</h4>"

A string is simply text inside quotes that the program can use (such as for printing). Strings are part of a larger family known as <b>variables</b>. Variables are simply named pieces of data such as numbers. Creating a variable is very useful if we want to reuse the data.<br>\n",
    "Declaring/creating a variable follows the format <b><i>name = value</i></b>. For example if we wanted to create a variable called 'name' with the value 'Bob' we would type; <b>name = \"Bob\"</b>. See how we're still using quotes to tell the program the Bob is a string.<br>\n",

I would reccommend making comments wherever you think you may need reminding about what a line does next time you come back to your code.<br>To write a single line comment we use a <b>#</b> symbol at the start of the line to tell python that this line should not be executed.\n",
